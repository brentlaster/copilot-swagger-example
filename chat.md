The key documentation extracted from the provided code and file structure highlights the setup and configuration of a Spring Boot application with Swagger for API documentation. Here's a summary:

### Project Structure
- **Maven Wrapper**: Ensures a consistent build environment by using a specific Maven version without requiring it to be installed on machines where the project is built.
- **Spring Boot Application**: Located at [`SpringbootSwaggerApplication.java`](src/main/java/com/hendisantika/springboot/swagger/SpringbootSwaggerApplication.java), it serves as the entry point to the application.
- **Swagger Configuration**: Defined in [`SwaggerConfig.java`](src/main/java/com/hendisantika/springboot/swagger/SwaggerConfig.java), it configures Swagger 2 for generating API documentation.
- **Employee Management**: The application includes an `EmployeeController` for handling API requests and an [`EmployeeService`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fspring-boot-swagger%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fhendisantika%2Fspringboot%2Fswagger%2Fservice%2FEmployeeService.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A16%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%5D "src/main/java/com/hendisantika/springboot/swagger/service/EmployeeService.java") for business logic, both under the `com.hendisantika.springboot.swagger` package.

### Maven Dependencies ([`pom.xml`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fspring-boot-swagger%2Fpom.xml%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/workspaces/spring-boot-swagger/pom.xml"))
- **Spring Boot Starter Web**: For building web, including RESTful, applications using Spring MVC. Uses Apache Tomcat as the default embedded container.
- **Spring Boot Starter Data JPA**: For integrating Spring Data JPA with Hibernate.
- **Spring Boot Starter Actuator**: Provides production-ready features to help you monitor and manage your application.
- **MySQL Connector Java**: MySQL JDBC driver for database connectivity.
- **Lombok**: For reducing boilerplate code in Java classes.
- **Springfox Boot Starter**: Simplifies the integration of Springfox (Swagger) into Spring Boot applications.
- **JFairy**: For generating fake data for testing or bootstrapping your application.

### Swagger UI
- The application is configured to serve Swagger UI, which provides a web-based UI for interacting with the API's documentation. The documentation can be accessed at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`.

### Testing
- The project structure includes a `test` directory for unit and integration tests, specifically with a test class for the Spring Boot application located at [`SpringbootSwaggerApplicationTests.java`](src/test/java/com/techupskills/springboot/swagger/SpringbootSwaggerApplicationTests.java).

### Configuration
- **Application Properties**: Configured in [`application.yml`](src/main/resources/application.yml), it contains application-specific settings including server port, database configuration, and more.

### Build and Run
- **Maven Wrapper Scripts**: [`mvnw`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fspring-boot-swagger%2Fmvnw%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/workspaces/spring-boot-swagger/mvnw") and [`mvnw.cmd`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fspring-boot-swagger%2Fmvnw.cmd%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/workspaces/spring-boot-swagger/mvnw.cmd") for Unix/Linux and Windows environments respectively, facilitate building and running the application without requiring a global Maven installation.
- **Spring Boot Maven Plugin**: Configured in [`pom.xml`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fspring-boot-swagger%2Fpom.xml%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/workspaces/spring-boot-swagger/pom.xml"), it simplifies the packaging and running of Spring Boot applications.

### Documentation URLs
- The README file provides URLs for accessing the Swagger UI documentation of the API, showcasing how to interact with the application's endpoints.
